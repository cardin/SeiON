## What is SeiON?
SeiON is an Actionscript 3 Sound Engine. Its goal is to provide a simplistic, fuss-free way to manage sound playback within Flash/Flex.

SeiON does the following:

* Provides global control of all sounds played
* Allows for pause/resume playback for sounds.
* Provides ability for playback of gapless MP3 loops in Flex.
* Manages finished/unwanted sound instances.

As SeiON only accepts Sound() objects as input, it is most suitable for embedded sounds, sounds on the local filesystem, or sounds that do not require streaming.
