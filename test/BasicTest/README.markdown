### Why are the demo assets & compiled swf not here?
It's not appropriate to host binary files, especially compiled ones, on GitHub as there is no point to version controlling a binary file. Even worse, Git keeps an archive of all files that ever existed in a respository. Thus when contributors run git clone, all revisions of the binaries will be downloaded, which easily run into Megabytes, instead of the Kilobytes that the library is right now.

### So where's the demo sound assets?
They're right here on the download page <http://github.com/cardin/SeiON/downloads>.

### So where's the compiled demos?
The compiled demos are hosted on <http://cardinal4.co.cc/SeiON/v0.3.0/demos>. The directory sometimes show empty - an error on the server - but refresh the page; the swfs are most definitely there.
